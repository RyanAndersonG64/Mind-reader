# Mind Reader Project

This simple web app asks the user to think of a number and perform specific arithmetic operations on it to arrive at a new number.  
This new number corresponds with a particular symbol, and the last page of the app reveals a specific symbol.
Due to the nature of the math involved, the final number will always be a multiple of 9; as long as each multiple of 9 corresponds to the symbol revealed on the last page,
the user will always arrive at that symbol and the app appears to have read their mind.
